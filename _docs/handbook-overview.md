Soapstone Cluster is a Home Owners Association, required under VA law to be managed by an elected Board of Directors drawn from the owners of the properties. Soapstone Cluster is incorporated as a non-stock Corporation under the provisions of Chapter 2 of Title 13.1 of the Code of Virginia. All land common to a Cluster of townhomes was deeded by the developer to Soapstone Cluster Association. This includes streets, sidewalks, tot lots, playgrounds, wooded areas and perimeter areas.

The Soapstone Cluster property is bordered on the west by Soapstone Drive, to the south of Soft Wind Court by Glade Drive, to the east by 30 acres of prime open space known as the Walker Nature Center, and on the north, by common land for utility easements. 

The original model homes were located in Soft Wind Court and opened in the fall of 1972. The first Woodhollow Court residents moved into their homes in March 1973, followed by Hearthstone Court residents the following year. The last of the 80 Soapstone Cluster homes was sold by Gulf Reston in late 1977. In 1974 Gulf Reston turned over management of Soapstone Cluster to our elected Board of Directors.  

Until 2005, Soapstone Cluster was managed by Members elected to the Board of Directors. In 2005, a property management company was hired to manage the Cluster’s financial interests. The Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring the management company’s work, conducting all other business of the Cluster and maintaining the common grounds. Soapstone Cluster has a tradition of relying on volunteer help to get projects completed for the benefit of all of the Members. The Board of Directors encourages everyone to help when asked and to serve on the Board of Directors when there are vacancies.
