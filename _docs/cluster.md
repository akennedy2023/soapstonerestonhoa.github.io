## Good Neighbors
All residents are expected to comply with the policies outlined in this handbook.  Non-resident landlords are responsible for ensuring that their tenants are aware of, and comply with, the policies as well. Compliance by all residents within the Cluster will help us maintain a clean, safe, and attractive environment for all.  

Please remember - neighborliness extends through walls. Unfortunately, sound can travel through common walls. Carefully choose locations, volume and use of musical instruments and entertainment systems. Some noise penetration is unavoidable. Under special circumstances such as infants, illness, or unusual work and rest schedules, give additional consideration and respect for your neighbor. In the spring and fall, when windows are open, excess noise from parties inside and outside can be disturbing. Try to be a good neighbor.

## Pets
Dogs should not be allowed to run free in the common property areas. Fairfax County leash laws are enforced. All dogs require licenses by Fairfax County. See the county Web site for detailed information: http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/living/animals/.

The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) warns that one single dog dropping can contain 3 million fecal bacteria, including e.coli and Salmonella, along with parasites and viruses that can that be passed to humans adults and children as well as other pets. Rain carries the contaminants into stream and lakes. It is Fairfax County law and common sense to pick up after your dog wherever he poops. Please deposit the bags of waste in your own trash can which is serviced twice a week. The public cans are not frequently emptied. 

To report dog(s) running loose, problems with barking dog(s) or other noise problems that have not been resolved, call the Fairfax County Police non-emergency number, 703-691-2131.

## Outside Lights  

Residents are responsible for keeping the pole lights outside their homes in working order and should replace burnt-out bulbs without delay. Keeping the Cluster well lighted benefits all residents by preventing accidents and improving security throughout the Cluster.

 
## Snow Removal  
The Board of Directors is responsible for obtaining snow removal services. The snow removal contractor will clear the parking lots according to the contract. Parking is not allowed along the yellow painted curbs. This blocks traffic and presents hazards for snow removal equipment and emergency vehicles. When it snows sufficiently to require plowing, further consideration should also be given to not parking along the curbs near the entrances to the lots or in other constricted areas, as this will inhibit the plow’s ability to clear the lots. Vehicles preventing snow removal from the lots are subject to towing. Residents are responsible for clearing their reserved parking spaces and walkways in front of their own homes. Deposit snow on front lawns or common areas. Do NOT pile snow in the open parking lot or unreserved spaces. If a neighbor removes snow from an unreserved parking space, give them consideration for their efforts by NOT parking in that space. 

## Trash Collection
Soapstone Cluster has a contract to provide trash removal for residents at an amount less than possible on an individual basis. Trash is collected once a week on Thursday. Trash should be bagged or in reusable containers and placed on the curb of the parking lot the night before each pick up day. Trash and recycling containers should not be placed in the parking lot.  This is especially important in winter when our snow removal service needs all the space available to push the snow off the lot. Please do not put your trash out for collection earlier. Trash left at the curb attracts animals and causes unsanitary and unsightly conditions.
In addition to regular service, the current trash company, American Disposal Services, will pick up special large items on Fridays; residents must call ADS at least 24 hours in advance. (There may be an extra charge for large/bulk items such as washing machines.) The telephone number for large items and customer service is 703-368-0500 or 866-884-8700. They also provide pick up of Christmas trees after the holidays.
Under the current contract, ADS will provide a 64 gallon trash and recycling container (Toter.)  Please contact ADS regarding provision or replacement of these items. 

## Recycling 
In addition to the once-weekly trash collection, there is collection of recycled items once a week on Thursday. Place all recycling on the curb on the night before. Place recycled materials either in paper bags or in the reusable containers provided by the trash company. DO NOT use plastic bags for recycling products. Plastic bags may be recycled at the local grocery stores. For further information on materials that are appropriate for recycling in Fairfax County, see the Web site, http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/living/recycling/.

For additional disposal and recycling, the I-66 Transfer Station on 4618 West Ox Rd, Fairfax, VA 22030 will take a wide variety of materials including household toxic materials such as chemicals, pesticides, batteries, etc., old appliances, and building materials. Search on “I-66 Transfer Station” for complete information.

## Communications
Formal business communication to residents such as invoices for Cluster dues and documents for the annual meeting are mailed out by the property management company. The Cluster newsletter and other informal communications, including public interest announcements, are sent to residents via email. Please make sure that the board has your updated email address or you may miss important information. 

## Common Walls
Soapstone dwellings are built in small rows of townhouses so that every house has at least one common wall with a neighbor, and most having two. When a wall projects away from the neighboring house, it then becomes an exterior wall that is the property and responsibility of the house it encloses. Further, the privacy fence between adjoining properties is considered common property. If a homeowner contemplates performing repairs or improvements (painting, plastering, siding, etc.), it is appropriate and neighborly to tell your neighbor of your plans.  Notice is required if the exterior wall can only be reached easily through the property, yard or roof, of the house next door. Prior discussion could prevent embarrassment or problems, such as trespass. Please note Reston Association requirement for certain repairs/improvements in the Reston Association section.

## Occupancy Limits
Fairfax County regulates the number of unrelated people who can live in one house. Please see http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/consumer/tenant/tl-handbook.pdf for further information.

## Cluster Directory
The Soapstone Cluster Directory is updated periodically. Please inform a Board Member if a telephone number changes. Landlords are required to notify the Board of Directors when new tenants move into a rented property. If you are new to our neighborhood, please contact a current Board Member to provide your information. New residents are added as soon as possible.

## Common Grounds  

Soapstone Cluster consists of 13 acres. A map of cluster property is located at Appendix C.  Cluster property extends into the wooded area that surrounds the cluster. Beyond Cluster property is the Walker Nature Center. All rules that apply to Cluster common grounds apply to all wooded areas including the Walker Nature Center. Following are some guidelines for the use and maintenance of the Cluster common grounds:

* Fairfax County laws regarding leash laws and pet waste apply to Cluster common grounds.  All dogs must be on leashes. “The owner or custodian of any dog shall be responsible for the removal of excreta deposited by such dogs on the property of another including public areas.” (Fairfax County Code) Also, dog urine kills grass. Please take your dogs onto areas other than grass.  
* Property owners will confine their landscaping, animal runs, storage and structural play areas to the land within their property lines.  Easements  common ground immediately adjacent to private property  must be kept clear of shrubbery and items so that home owners and emergency crews can easily gain access to the rear entrance of every residence.
* No trash or yard waste is to be discarded onto common grounds, such as, Christmas trees, building materials, limbs from cut trees, large amounts of leaves and anything else that will take years to decompose. These items should be taken to the Fairfax County land fill (I-66 Transfer Station, see page 9) or bagged and put out for trash pickup. The State and Reston Association dumping regulations are listed below:
  * **Virginia State Code – Illegal Dumping- 33.2-802:** 
    * “…It shall be unlawful for any person to dump or otherwise dispose of trash, garbage, refuse and litter…or other unsightly matter on public property without the written consent of the owner…”
  * **Reston Association bylaws – Deed Section V1.2:**
    * (b) Refuse and Debris.  Storage or disposal of refuse or debris on the Common Area or in the lakes is prohibited. 
  * **Reston Association- Common Area Rules& Regulations Resolution 1:**
    * 4. Dumping of any refuse including but not limited to grass clippings, leaves, Christmas trees, appliances, old sofas, crank case oil, etc. is prohibited.
* The storm sewers located in each parking lot empty directly into the Nature Center, streams and local lakes. Chemicals, such as antifreeze, oil, detergent and paint should be handled very carefully so as not to spill in the parking lot. Debris like litter, leaves and trash should be kept away from storm drains and ditches so that they do not end up in the woods and then the local streams and lakes. Cars that leak oil must be repaired promptly.  The oil destroys the asphalt and also pollutes local streams and lakes.
* The common grounds will be retained in as natural a state as possible. Any development or change must be approved by Reston Association through the DRB application process.
* Removal of plants or soil is prohibited. 
* No hunting or trapping of wildlife. No firearms, air guns, BB guns or archery equipment are to be discharged or carried onto common ground.
* County ordinance prohibits the use of motor vehicles on the walkways or common lands of Reston, including Soapstone common ground, with the exception of maintenance vehicles and law enforcement vehicles.
