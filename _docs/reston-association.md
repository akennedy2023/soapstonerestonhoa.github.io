## Reston Association (RA)

As residents of Soapstone Cluster, we have two local levels of governance, Reston Association and Soapstone Cluster Association. While Reston is not a town, Reston Association provides a level of government-type services. It provides recreational facilities such as the pools and tennis courts, maintenance of public property within the limits of Reston and stewardship of Reston’s environmental and natural resources. Reston is a planned community. When you purchased your property, you agreed to comply with the property covenants and so help to maintain the design standard that was established for Reston properties.

RA activities are funded primarily by assessments, established by its Board of Directors each year, against all residential property. (RA annual assessments are billed separately from Soapstone Cluster Association’s quarterly assessments.)

Additional information is available at http://www.reston.org/.

The RA offices are located at 12001 Sunrise Valley Dr, Reston, VA 20191. The telephone number for information is (703) 435-6530.  


## Design Review Board (DRB)

The DRB controls all exterior renovations and additions to homes in Reston. The DRB was established by the protective covenants that are a part of every deed of home ownership in Reston. The DRB is charged with reviewing all applications for exterior alterations to make sure they are in keeping with the standards set forth in the covenants.

The DRB approval is not only limited to major changes—the Design Review Board considers everything from additions such as decks and fences to changes in house or door colors. Any external modifications or changes must have prior approval of the DRB. DRB approval applications and information about approved colors, materials and plans can be found on the Design Review Board section of the Reston Association website.
