## Parking Policy

Parking spaces in Soapstone Cluster are very limited, with slightly more than two spaces per household. This presents a serious problem when households park more than two cars in the lot.  In addition to contributing to parking problems, unused, broken down cars are an eyesore. The following paragraphs outline a parking policy designed to maximize our limited parking, while maintaining a safe and ascetically pleasing environment within the cluster. They address resident rights, requirements, resolution of disputes and enforcement of the parking policy.

## Parking Rights

Each Household in Soapstone Cluster is entitled to use at least one parking space for an approved motor vehicle, and to the right of ingress and egress in and upon the parking area.  The reserved spot is marked with an R-# (associated to its designated townhouse). All visitor (unreserved) spots are first come first serve, and are not linked to any specific homes. This applies to the homeowners as well as visitors. An approved motor vehicle includes any conventional passenger vehicle, or truck of less than 2 1/2 tons (5000 lbs.) gross weight.  

Parking of commercial vehicles should also be in compliance with local, county and state law. Section 82-5-7 of the Fairfax County Code prohibits parking of commercial vehicles in residential districts. Vehicles parked in violation are subject to a $100 fine for each violation and may be towed at the owner's expense.

Other types of vehicles, including, but not limited to house trailers, motor homes, boats on trailers, utility trailers or vehicles occupying more than one parking space, are not permitted to park in the Cluster parking lot. Space for these vehicles can be rented from the Reston Association at a special lot off Sunset Hills Rd.  Call 703 437-7658.

## Vehicle Requirements

All vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks) parked in the Cluster must have valid registration/inspection stickers, and valid/up to date VA license plates. The vehicle must be maintained in proper operating condition so as not to be a safety hazard or nuisance by noise, emissions or appearance. Any vehicle which is in disrepair such that it cannot be operated in its existing condition because the parts necessary, such as, but not limited to tires, windshield, engine, drive train, driver’s seat, steering wheel or column, gas or brake pedals, are removed, deteriorating, damaged or destroyed, may not be parked on Cluster property. No vehicle (scooter, motorcycle, truck, car) or any other equipment/object can be used to reserve a visitor spot. Any vehicle not being actively used MUST be stored in your reserved spot. If you own a motorcycle or scooter, it MUST be stored in the front of your reserved spot or on your property. Households with greater than 3 vehicles must park the extra vehicles on Soapstone Drive so that they are not monopolizing the shared lot.

## Parking Areas

Vehicles may be parked only in designated parking spaces within the Cluster, bordered by either a curb and white line, or two white lines. Vehicles are not allowed to park parallel to any other curbs, including, but not limited to the large island on Hearthstone Court. These areas are designated fire lanes and are posted with no parking signs. Residents may not park within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, except in a designated parking spot.

Residents are asked to consider their neighbors’ needs and cooperate with each other in parking vehicles within the Cluster. If a legally registered and maintained car is out of use for an extended period of time, the owner is requested to park in their reserved space so as to not monopolize our limited parking. 

**On street parking along Soapstone Drive is recommended for guests to our community.  We have a limited number of parking spaces available and they should be available to our residents. Please be considerate of you neighbors.**
 
## Parking Disputes

Where possible, residents are asked to talk with neighbors to resolve parking disputes, including the use of reserved and non-reserved spaces. When a car is parked in one’s reserved space, it is recommended that initially a simple request be placed on the windshield to inform the driver that they have parked in a reserved space.  

## Notice of Violation

When exceptions to this parking policy are identified, a Board Member shall serve a written notice on the owner of the vehicle, if known, and upon the vehicle itself.  Notice will be given at least ten (10) days before the vehicle is towed and shall be deemed as given when notification is posted on the door of the owner, if known, and upon the vehicle. Vehicle owners may contact a Board Member to negotiate an extension to this notice period, where appropriate

If a vehicle is found parked along a fire lane or blocking access to or egress from the parking areas, a warning will be posted on the vehicle at least 24 hours before towing. However, if an emergency vehicle (to include the snow plow) is unable to negotiate around a violating vehicle, a Board Member may have the vehicle towed immediately. Likewise, if a vehicle is blocking ingress or egress from the parking areas, a Board Member may have the vehicle towed immediately. If notice has been posted on a vehicle at least three times, it may, at the Board's discretion, be towed without notice the next time it is found to be in violation.

## Towing Vehicles in Violation of Parking Policy

Any vehicle not brought into compliance with the parking policy following notification of violation shall be towed. Towing companies are required to notify the Police Department when a car has been towed. A resident who finds their car has been towed should call 703 691-2131 (the police non-emergency number) to make arrangements to have their car released.  

## Enforcement of the Parking Policy

Only a Member of the Association Board of Directors shall enforce the parking policy as stated herein, including, but not limited to posting notices on cars and providing for towing of a vehicle. 

These guidelines are designed to help the over crowded parking lot in our community, and to help encourage fairness and equal opportunity to all residents. Thank you for your consideration and helping our community remain a wonderful place to live. If you have any questions, please contact the Board Vice President or a Board Member in your section. Please feel free to join the parking committee; we are open to suggestions or concerns regarding parking issues.

A letter outlining this policy will be distributed on an annual basis to all townhouses within the cluster. A copy of the parking warning notice and policy letter can be found at Appendix B.
